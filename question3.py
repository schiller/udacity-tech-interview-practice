# Question 3
# Given an undirected graph G, find the minimum spanning tree within G. 
# A minimum spanning tree connects all vertices in a graph with the smallest 
# possible total weight of edges. 
# Your function should take in and return an adjacency list structured like this:

# {'A': [('B', 2)],
#  'B': [('A', 2), ('C', 5)], 
#  'C': [('B', 5)]}

# Vertices are represented as unique strings. 
# The function definition should be question3(G)
